									<p> My area of research goes from theoretical research related to formal methods to its application to different domains. In the more theoretical aspects, 
										I work on concurrency, refinement, and inference systems, and programming language semantics, among others. </p>
								    <p> The non-theoretical side covers an heterogenous domain of applications in which I highlight micro-kernel security, 
										quantum computing, smart-contracts, and hardware verification. I am also interested on the application of formal methods to 5G infrastructures, 
										EV, IoT, Unmanned Vehicles and Mavlink protocol verification </p>
								    <p> I have recently being awarded with a Singapore MoE-Tier 1 project: <i> MOSES: A Meta Executable Operational Semantics for Efficient Smart Contract Verification</i> <br>
									    In this project I aim to construct a meta-sematincs for smart-contract programming languages. This will be the base for an intermediate language to which translate smart-contracts developed in different languages, having a common verification framework based on that language</p>

									<h3>Research</h3>
									<p> I am currently finishing a verification framework in Isabelle/HOL for quantum computing programs using separation logic. It is based on our work published in POPL'22, 
										improving it and fixing a number of errors that I detected during the formalization. Once this is done, I plan to continue working on this line by adding incorrectness logic</p>
									<p> I am also working on a very promising framework for the verification of sequential systems. The verification is highly automated among other things thanks to what we call phi-types. 
										Phi-types introduce refinement in the verification assertions, allowing to reason over high level specifications, while the verification is done over low level specifications. 
										This together with separation logic bring refinement to a new level enhancing its automation, becoming more powerful than just abstract refinement.</p>
								    <p> I keep working on compositional verification of concurrent systems, and its application to cyber-physical systems. 
										I started this line when I was in NTU and thanks to it we were awarded with several NRF grants</p>
								    
									<p> Other research lines in which I worked in the past and that I still keep researching in is Micro-Kernel verification, from the source code to the machine code, using formal proofs.
									   This involves the creation of frameworks and tools for the compositional verification of the micro-kernel from an abstract specification based on the ARINC-653 standard for
									   partitioning micro-kernels. I verified some parts of a concurrent micro-kernel specification and its refinement with the implementation. 
									   The complexity of the verification of the micro-kernel makes necessary to have a team of several people working on the different verification tasks, in which I played a team coordinator role. </p>

									<p> In relation to the micro-kernel verification, I worked also on the semantics of the SPARC v8+ ISA and weak memory models.  </p>

									<p> I have also collaborated on the formal verification of the Leon3 processor, a SPARC V8+ multi-core CPU and
									   in the formalization of executable semantics for the RUST language for safe code generation, and in the research of compositional techniques for verification scalability. </p>
									<p> Overall I am interested on anything related to formal methods and logic, and applying to real-world domains. I am open to collaborate on this topics </p>
